title: Setup
---

This workshop will demonstrate how to use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) in order to write
and render LaTeX documents. Overleaf is a cloud-based LaTeX editor, meaning that you can access it
from any computer with an internet connection, without the need to install any additional software.
As part of the preparation for workshop, you should register for an account on Overleaf.

## Software Setup

Optionally, it is possible to write and render LaTeX documents on your local machine. You will
need both a TeX system and an text editor installed. The TeX system is responsible for compiling
and rendering the LaTeX document, while the text editor is where you will write the LaTeX code.

There are two popular TeX systems: [TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive/) and
[MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/). Each of these has it's own advantages and disadvantages. A detailed
comparison can be found on [The LaTeX Project Website](https://www.latex-project.org/get/).
