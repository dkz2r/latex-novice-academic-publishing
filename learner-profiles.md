## Myka Robiota:

Myka Robiota is a phD student pursuing a doctoral degree in microbiology. Mykaâ€™s research focuses on microbial communities and their role in environmental sustainability. Myka's work involves analyzing data, writing technical papers, and preparing presentations for conferences. She frequently need to include detailed diagrams, complex tables, and properly formatted citations in her academic writing. Myka has relied on traditional word processors but finds them limiting, particularly when dealing with formatting issues and the inclusion of mathematical or chemical equations.

Motivation for Learning LaTeX:
To streamline the process of preparing research manuscripts for submission to high-impact journals in microbiology.
To create polished, professional-looking documents with ease, particularly those requiring precise formatting of tables, figures, and equations.
To develop a skill widely recognized and valued in the academic community.

## Dr. Petri Dishman

Dr. Petri Dishman is a postdoctoral researcher specializing in microbiology, with a focus on antibiotic resistance mechanisms in pathogenic bacteria. Petri's work includes designing experiments, analyzing complex datasets, and collaborating with multidisciplinary teams. As part of his role, he frequently writes grant proposals, drafts manuscripts for publication in leading journals, and prepares technical reports. He also mentors graduate students, assisting them with their own research presentations and academic writing.

Motivation for Learning LaTeX:
To create professional and well-formatted research articles, grant proposals, and collaborative documents efficiently.
To produce clear, publication-ready tables, figures, and mathematical expressions, especially for manuscripts targeting high-impact journals.
To acquire a versatile skill that can enhance both personal productivity and his ability to support students in their academic endeavors.
